## Problems

I have in both my projects several issues when using codeanywhere. In this project I made several changes and made commits but nothing went back to Github. 

## Getting project to start

My first thought was to define alll the variables after detimening that I was going to use three questions with four different answers. Only one of these answers was going to be correct.
After you pushed the submit button You would get your Score and the results of each Question.
When you got a correct answer listed in the "const correctAnswers" this will add a point and add all the correct answers.


## Features

    ⁃	__Questions__
    ⁃	__Score__
    ⁃	__Coffe icon__

This is on the main page and is responsive.
It will allow you to go to the different sections on the page.

## Features left to implement

    ⁃	__More questions__
    ⁃	__Perhaps a better score visual feature__
    



## Testing

    ⁃	__ I have used preview in all the common webb browsers and checked them with different screen sizes.__

## Validator

- **HTML** - Got warning on the (id="question"). 
Warning: The first occurrence of ID question was here.
- **CSS** - Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.

## Deployment

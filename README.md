Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **July 26th, 2023**

## Problems

I have in both my projects several issues when using codeanywhere. In this project I made several changes and made commits but nothing went back to Github. My first thought was to define alll the variables after detimening that I was going to use three questions with four different answers. Only one of these answers was going to be correct.
After you pushed the submit button You would get your Score and the results of each Question.
When you got a correct answer listed in the "const correctAnswers" this will add a point and add all the correct answers.

`python3 -m http.server`

It’s magic in a bottle!

## Testing

    ⁃	__ I have used preview in all the common webb browsers and checked them with different screen sizes.__
    ⁃	__I ran into problem with the fist sketch when I try to implement it in html and css code. My solution was to simplify it and bring it down to basics but still maintaining the same goals with the project.__
